A personal data project designed to track and analyze job applications. The goal is to transform my job-hunting process into a structured, visual dataset that helps me identify trends — such as most requested skills, application frequency, and success patterns over time.

⚙️ ETL workflow

This project follows a lightweight ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built entirely with no-code and low-code tools.
